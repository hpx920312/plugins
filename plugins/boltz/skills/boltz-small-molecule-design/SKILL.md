description: Design new small-molecule binders with Boltz. Use when generating novel ligands or hits for a target without a fixed compound library. Not for screening existing molecules or one-off docking.
---

## Workflow

If `boltz-api` is missing from `PATH`, use `boltz-cli-setup` for install/update guidance before retrying.
If a command reports missing or expired authentication, use `boltz-cli-setup` to start `boltz-api auth login --device-code` before retrying; do not ask permission first.
If the agent host sandbox blocks `boltz-api` install/auth/API calls, use `boltz-cli-setup` to request the host sandbox bypass/escalation needed for user-wide CLI install, browser login, credential storage, temp files, or API access before retrying.

Use this skill when the user wants de novo small-molecule binders (no existing library).

1. Normalize the target: one or more protein sequences into `target.entities`, plus optional `pocket_residues` (0-based) and/or `reference_ligands` (known binders to seed pocket detection).
2. Pick `num_molecules` — minimum **10**, server rejects anything lower. If the user says a smaller number, explain the floor and propose 10.
3. Only add `chemical_space` (e.g. `"enamine_real"`) if the user explicitly wants synthesis-aware generation within that library.
4. Supported optional features include `chemical_space` and `molecule_filters`; only add them on explicit request. Read [references/api.md](references/api.md) for exact shapes and filter options.
5. Author the payload YAML or JSON, run `estimate-cost`, show the USD cost, wait for explicit confirmation. Cost is approximately $0.025 per molecule for small targets (may scale with complex size); always quote `estimated_cost_usd` from the response rather than a hardcoded formula.
6. `start` to submit (synchronous). Capture the ID.
7. Launch `download-results` with the agent runtime's background/non-blocking command facility; it polls, paginates, downloads per-hit structures, and exits when terminal. In Claude Code, use Bash with `run_in_background: true`. In Codex, run `download-results` as a foreground shell command with `yield_time_ms: 1000`; if Codex returns a `session_id`, keep it for optional later polling. After launching it, report the job ID, run name, and output directory, then end the turn immediately. Do not wait on the background session unless the user explicitly asks for progress.
8. Rank hits from `<output-root>/<run-name>/results/index.jsonl` by `binding_confidence` for hit discovery or `optimization_score` for lead optimization. Read [references/results.md](references/results.md) for output layout and metric details.

## Command Pattern

```bash
# Replace placeholders with concrete absolute paths before running.
# Use a short descriptive run name, for example: sm-design-<target>-<batch>-v1

boltz-api small-molecule:design estimate-cost \
  --input @yaml:///absolute/path/payload.yaml

boltz-api small-molecule:design start \
       --idempotency-key "<run-name>" \
       --input @yaml:///absolute/path/payload.yaml \
       --raw-output --transform id

# Copy the printed job ID into this command, then launch it in the agent
# runtime's background/non-blocking mode.
# Claude Code: Bash with run_in_background=true.
# Codex: foreground shell command with yield_time_ms=1000; keep the returned session_id if one is provided.
# Do not append "&" or use nohup in Codex.
boltz-api download-results \
  --id "<job-id-from-start>" --name "<run-name>" \
  --root-dir "/absolute/path/boltz-experiments" \
  --poll-interval-seconds 60
# -> /absolute/path/boltz-experiments/<run-name>/results/<pres_*>/...
```

Payload keys are `num_molecules`, `target`, `chemical_space`, `molecule_filters` — the API body field names.

## Always Do This

- Enforce `num_molecules >= 10` before calling `estimate-cost`. The server rejects smaller batches.
- Cost is approximately $0.025 per molecule for small targets (may scale with complex size). Always quote `estimated_cost_usd` from `estimate-cost` rather than a hardcoded per-molecule rate.
- Treat pocket residue indices as 0-based.
- Keep payload field names exactly as the API body names shown in `references/api.md`.
- Use absolute paths for the output root, payload files, and embedded target files. Do not `cd` into the run directory for follow-up commands; pass the same `--root-dir` and use absolute paths so later relative paths do not drift.
- Prefer one merged top-level payload via `--input @yaml:///absolute/path/payload.yaml` or `@json:///absolute/path/payload.json` for `estimate-cost` and `start`. Keep `--idempotency-key` and `--workspace-id` top-level; if they also appear inside `--input`, the top-level flags win.
- Direct object flags still work as overrides: for example `--target @yaml:///absolute/path/target.yaml` or `--molecule-filters @json:///absolute/path/filters.json`. Piped YAML / JSON on stdin also works, but it must use API body field names. Never use `@file://`.
- Use the same slug as both `--idempotency-key` at submit and `--name` on `download-results`.
- In permission-gated agents such as Claude Code, keep each Boltz call as a top-level command that starts with `boltz-api`. Prefer concrete arguments over `sh -c`, inline environment assignments, aliases, wrapper scripts, loops, or pipelines around the `boltz-api` invocation unless the user already allowed that exact command form. Use `--raw-output --transform id`, read the printed ID, then paste that literal ID into the next `download-results` command.
- Prefer the agent runtime's background/non-blocking command mode for `download-results`. In Codex specifically, keep `download-results` in the foreground and set the shell tool yield to 1000 ms; Codex will return a `session_id` if the command is still running. Do not append `&` or use `nohup` in Codex because the tool runner may clean up shell-backgrounded descendants before `.boltz-run.json` is fully written.
- After the background/session starts, do not wait on it or poll it. Design jobs can run 30 min to a few hours — `--poll-interval-seconds 60` is a sensible default. `download-results` emits JSONL progress on stderr by default; add `--progress-format text --verbose` only when you explicitly want human-readable logs. Report the job ID, run name, output directory, and that the runtime should notify when the background command completes.
- Only check status when the user asks. In Codex, poll the saved session with an empty `write_stdin`, or prefer `boltz-api --format json download-status --name "<run-name>" --root-dir "/absolute/path/boltz-experiments"` for structured local checkpoint state. Never run a manual poll loop.
- If detached download needs to be restarted, re-run `boltz-api download-results` with the same `--name "<run-name>"` and the same `--root-dir`.
- Do not invent filters; only add `molecule_filters` on user request.

## Escape Hatch

- Payload reference: <https://boltz-compute-api.stldocs.app/api/python/resources/small_molecule/subresources/design/methods/start>
- CLI flag names: `boltz-api small-molecule:design start --help`

Read [references/api.md](references/api.md) for the `target`, `chemical_space`, and `molecule_filters` shapes (filter catalog matches the screen endpoint). Read [references/results.md](references/results.md) after download when ranking generated molecules or explaining outputs.

## Outputs

Rank from `results/index.jsonl` after `download-results`; use [references/results.md](references/results.md) for local file layout and metric meanings.
